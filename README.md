# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

This project implements a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits using TensorFlow. It includes Jupyter Notebook exercises (`C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb `) and a dataset file (`ex3data1.mat`). The goal is to train a neural network model to accurately classify images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.


## Usage

1. Open `C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb ` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and visualize the results.
3. The notebook includes sections for loading the dataset, implementing softmax function, constructing the neural network model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset (`ex3data1.mat`) contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits. Each example is a 20-pixel by 20-pixel grayscale image, which is "unrolled" into a 400-dimensional vector. The corresponding labels indicate the digit represented in each image.

## How to Run

Ensure that you have Python, TensorFlow, and Jupyter Notebook installed. Open the `C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially. You can adjust parameters, experiment with different architectures, and explore the results.
